## Hypothesis on discrete 3D-metric on a 4D-brane in a 5D-bulk

> *This is not a theory. This is a hypothesis — a conceptual model with predictive power, ready for collaboration.*

## 🎯 Goal

To provide a **geometric framework** for unifying quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology through the lens of discrete rewriting on the Planck scale — where 3D spacetime is a dynamic face of a 4D-brane moving in a 5D-bulk.

## 🔬 Key Features

- ✅ **Discrete spacetime** on Planck scale (`ℓ_P`, `t_P`)
- ✅ **4D-brane as fundamental object**, 3D as its face
- ✅ **5D-bulk as self-contained bubble** — creates illusion of infinity
- ✅ **256-particle model** — particles as phase angles `(φ₁, φ₂, φ₃, φ₄)`
- ✅ **Predictions**: drift of constants, dark matter as geometric effect, information preservation in black holes
- ✅ **Python tools**: generate particles, visualize phase space, export to CSV
